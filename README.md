# AWS_DBT_Snowflake_Preset_Data_Engineering_Project

**Project Details:** As part of the course provided by Udemy, I was able to experience executing the dbt tool with Snowflake to perform end to end project leveraging various concepts in the dbt tool

**End to End Process Implementation Overview**

1.  I was able to manually create tables in snowflake and loaded the data from S3 buckets
2.  Using Meterializations such as views, tables, incremental and ephemeral, I was able to use raw tables and create SCD tables, DIM tables and Fact table
3.  I was able to implement Seeds, Source freshness, able to handle Snapshots on SCD type-2 DIM table
4.  I performed both Singlural and Generic tests (Unique, Not_Null, Accepted_Values and Relationships) on the datasets
5.  I leveraged Models, Macros, Custom Tests and Packages using Jinja templates
6.  I was able to generate the documentation and data lineage graph using dbt docs process
7.  I was able to Implement Hooks on the top of the datasets
8.  I was able to leverage dbt-expectations and implement sample tests on the datasets
9.  I used Preset to connect to Snowflake tables and created charts and dashboards

Dashboarding: I sign-up for Preset and was able to connect my datasets from Snowflake and able to implement Dashboard with multiple KPI metrics
